 About the Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flies have invaded Fishcake's home (yes, that's your name. No choice :D)! It's time to get rid of these flies!
Well, that's the job for pest control. So until they come to get rid of the flies, you count the flies to 
pass the time.

 How to Play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Each level is comprised of 3 waves of flies. In each wave there is a random number of flies that will pass
through the living hall. Your job is to count these flies and get it accurate! Just press spacebar to increase
the counter.
